                **Parties & Purpose:** “[Employer’s Name] (the “Petitioner”) submits this Response to the Request for Evidence (RFE) issued in connection with its H-1B petition for **[Beneficiary’s Name]** (the “Beneficiary”).”

                    RFE Issued: _[Date]_

                 **Summary of USCIS Concerns:**  
                    1. Question as to whether the position qualifies as a specialty occupation.

                    3. Adequacy of the job duties description.  

                **Rebuttal to USCIS Concerns**  
                 **Concern 1: Specialty Occupation Qualification**  
                    **USCIS Position:** “Position duties appear routine and not requiring a bachelor’s degree in a specific specialty.”  
                    **Rebuttal:**  
                    Detailed breakdown of primary duties demonstrating theoretical and practical application of a specialized field (see Section 2.1).  
                    Citation of SOC Code _[Code]_ description and AAO precedent (e.g., *Matter of Michael Hertz Associates*).  
                 **Concern 2: Beneficiary’s Credentials**  
                    **USCIS Position:** “Insufficient evidence that Beneficiary holds a degree in the required specialty.”  
                    **Rebuttal:**  
                    Submitted certified copy of diploma and official transcript (Ex. A).  
                    Credential evaluation report confirming U.S. equivalency to a bachelor’s degree in _[Field]_ (Ex. B).  
                 **Concern 3: Job Duties Description**  
                    **USCIS Position:** “Job description lacks specificity regarding specialized tasks.”  
                    **Rebuttal:**  
                    Revised job description with granular tasks tied to degree-level knowledge (Ex. C).  
                    Organizational chart illustrating Beneficiary’s role and reporting relationships (Ex. D).  
                 **Additional Legal Authority:**  
                    Cite INA § 214(i) and 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A) regarding specialty occupation definitions.  

                **Supporting Evidence & Exhibits**  
                 **Exhibit A:** Beneficiary’s diploma and official transcript (with certified translation).

                 **Eligibility Reaffirmed:** “Based on the expanded evidence and legal authorities cited, the Beneficiary clearly meets all requirements for classification in a specialty occupation under INA § 214(i).”  
                 **Request for Adjudication:** “Petitioner respectfully requests that USCIS approve the H-1B petition for **[Beneficiary’s Name]** promptly and notify the Petitioner by email at **[Email Address]**.”

                **Dear USCIS Officer,**  

                **Introduction**  
                - **Parties & Purpose:** “[Employer’s Name] (the “Petitioner”) submits this Data Collection Supplement in support of its H-1B petition for **[Beneficiary’s Name]** (the “Beneficiary”).”

                    Explain affiliation or control relationship (e.g., memorandum of understanding with University X).  
                    Provide rationale: research focus, public benefit, no commercial gain.  
                **Regulatory Compliance:**  
                    Cite relevant USCIS policy memoranda (e.g., “Fee Exemption for Nonprofit Research Organizations,” HQ 70/6.5.2†).  
                    Confirm that placement of Beneficiary does not generate net profit for Petitioner.

                The record demonstrates beyond question that the Beneficiary possesses the required academic credentials, specialized experience, and employer need for the role.
